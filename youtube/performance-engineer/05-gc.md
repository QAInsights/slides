# Garbage Collection 🚮

- *Automatic garbage collection is the process of looking at heap memory, identifying which objects are in use and which are not, and deleting the unused objects*
- automatic memory management 📝
- cleans up unreferenced objects 🚮
- expensive process 💰

--- 

# Type of Garbage Collection

- Minor GC
    - Young Generation 🐤
- Major GC
    - Older Generation 🐓
- Full GC
    - Young + Old 💯

---

# How GC works?

- Step 1 > Marking the unreferenced objects ✅
- Step 2 > Sweeping the unreferenced objects ❎
    - Compacting 📦📦📦

- Mark and Sweep process inefficient in a large heap
    - Young and Old Generations

- Minor GC - shortly lived objects 🤏
- Major GC - long lived objects 🏋️‍♀️

# Types of Collectors [1/2]

- Serial Collector `-XX:+UseSerialGC`
    - a single thread
- Parallel Collector `-XX:+UseParallelGC` 
    - multiple threads
- Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS) `-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC` 
    - commonly used collector
    - shorter garbage collection pauses
- Garbage-First (G1) `-XX:+UseG1GC`
    - commonly used collector
    - garbage collection pause-time goals with high probability
    - e.g. JMeter uses G1GC by default

---

# Types of Collectors [2/2]
- The Z Garbage Collector `-XX:+UseZGC`
    - scalable low latency garbage
    - all expensive work concurrently, without stopping the execution of application threads for more than 10ms
- Shenandoah `-XX:+UseShenandoahGC`
    - low pause time garbage collector that reduces GC pause times
- Epsilon `-XX:+UseEpsilonGC`
    - no-op garbage collector i.e. *do-nothing*
